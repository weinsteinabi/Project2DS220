## Format Requirement

- Algorithms in pseudo-code **MUST** be placed in code blocks/fences, and use `cpp` as the syntax highlighter. 
- Algorithms should follow the pseudo-code standard described in *Pseudocode Handout*. 
- Do NOT change the template except for the answer portion.
- Formulas and equations should be in math mode using Latex math symbols.
  - Markdown math tutorial: http://tug.ctan.org/info/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf 
  - Two ways to enter math mode:
    - Insert a pair of dollar signs: \$your equations go here\$. This is the inline math mode. *Notice no space between the \$ and the letter*.
    - Insert a pair of double-dollar signs: \$\$ your equations go here \$\$, which produces a standalone equation/formula set.
- Export your work to a **pdf** file for submission 

## Problem Set

### Problem 1

Design an algorithm in pseudo-code for computing $\lfloor \sqrt n \rfloor$ for any *positive* integer $n$. Besides assignment and comparison, your algorithm may only use the four basic arithmetical operations, namely:

- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division

### Problem 2

Find `gcd(31415, 14142)` by applying Euclid’s algorithm. Please show detailed steps. 

#### Answer

------

### Problem 3

Estimate how many times faster it will be to find `gcd(31415, 14142)` by Euclid’s algorithm compared with the algorithm based on checking consecutive integers from `min{m, n}` down to `gcd(m, n)`. 

*Hint*: to compare the performance, you may count the number of divisions each algorithm takes.

### Problem 4

Describe the algorithm in pseudo-code for finding the binary representation of a positive decimal integer.

Your code should be placed in a code block, for example:

```c++
Algorithm int2binary(num) {
  // finding the binary representation of a positive decimal integer
  // input: num - a positive decimal integer
  // output: Bin - an array of binary digits storing the binary form of num
  // to be completed
}
```
